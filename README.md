# OpenGLGraph

# Overview

This is a library that supports most of functions in "Graphics.h" used in ZJU for teaching.

It uses OpenGL to render all graphic component. Therefore, it inevitably disagrees with "Graphic.h" which use Win API to draw.

I have tried my best to make it compatible to the original library.

# TODO
- Things are disproportioned
- Mouse positon is inaccurate
- Text rendering is buggy
- All color must be registered before use, i will add colors to it.
- Key board Iput is buggy cuz every time it refresh will scan the keys.
